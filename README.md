# skarbal
Reference implementation of the Skarbal calendar.

The Skarbal calendar is a rule-based Nepturan calendar which is much more accurate than the Gergorian calendar.
Differences to the Gregorian calendar include:

* Exception to leap years occur regularly once every 128 years.
* Every date within a year has the same week day, independently of the year.
* Each quarter begins with a Monday. (Jan 1, Apr 1, Jul 1, Oct 1 are all Mondays)
* Weeks have 7 days, except for the last week of December, which contains an additional Day of Urane and, if a leap year, a Day of Neptune.
